# AWS
## WHAT IS AWS ?
### Iaas = Infrastructure as a service 
With infrastructure as a service (IaaS), you manage the server, which can be physical or virtual, and the operating system (Microsoft Windows or Linux). In general, the data center provider has no access to your server.
Basic building blocks for cloud IT include:
 * Networking features 
 * Compute 
 * Data storage space
### Paas = Platform as a service
Someone else manages the underlying hardware and operating systems. Thus you can run applications without managing underlying infrastructure (patching, updates, maintenance, hardware, operating systems). PaaS also provides a framework for developers that they can build on to create customized applications.
### Saas = Software as a service
You manage your files, and the service provider manages all data centers, servers, networks, storage, maintenance, and patching. Your concern is only the software and how you want to use it. You are provided with a complete product that the service provider runs and manages. Facebook and Dropbox are examples of SaaS. You manage your Facebook contacts and Dropbox files, and the service providers manage the systems
## What are webservices ?
A web service is any piece of software that makes itself available over the internet or on private (intranet) networks. A web service uses a standardized format for the request and the response of an application programming interface (API) interaction. For example, formats such as Extensible Markup Language (XML) or JavaScript Object Notation (JSON) can be used. Itâ€™s not tied to any one operating system (OS) or programming language. A web service is self-describing through an interface definition file and is discoverable.
